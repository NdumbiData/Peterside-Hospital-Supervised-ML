##  Project: Heart Disease Prediction

### Description
This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data. Using a dataset of 303 records with 14 key medical features, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making. 

Peterside Hospital, a private medical institution in Lagos, Nigeria, provided the dataset. The hospital is known for its advanced facilities and commitment to patient care, making this project a valuable step toward AI-driven healthcare solutions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

###  Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 14 features relevant to heart disease diagnosis, including:
- **Demographic**: Age, Sex
- **Medical Conditions**: Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Serum cholesterol
- **ECG & Exercise Test**: Maximum heart rate, Exercise-induced angina, ST depression
- **Fluoroscopy & Thalassemia**: Number of major vessels, Thalassemia type

###  Objective
Develop a predictive model that classifies patients as having heart disease (1) or not (0), helping healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions.

###  How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore data and train models.

###  Key Results
- **Feature Importance Analysis** to identify the most relevant predictors.
- **Performance Comparison** across multiple machine learning models.
- **Insights & Visualizations** to understand heart disease risk factors.

###  Future Enhancements
